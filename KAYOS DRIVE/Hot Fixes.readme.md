# FIGMENT TODM PATH PATCH


> The daytime Blueprint was ported with 4 Missing Vlaues 2 From the direct sun light, and 2 from the SKy atmosphere component. These values remained critical in how the landscape looked, felt, and reacted throughout the sequence playing if used.
 Before when played the World seem so bright, it was hard to look up, Bloom would sky rocket, and the sun color would remain 100, R 100 G 100 B 100 A. Causing the overal ll brightness to be off, causing a more whiting effect on the screen, 
instead of the proper display of color and value Corisponding to the time in the sequence the Blueprint was at. This ultimalty lead me to relize I left out values, therefore this morning, i was ablet o go back in- re
 adjust everything and showcase, Its proper values and how much better it looks, compared with grass, and overall world / in game look!
